## Voltage-Controlled Audio Preamplifier

The **Voltage-Controlled Audio Preamplifier** is an electronic device designed to amplify audio signals while allowing automatic gain adjustment through the application of a voltage to a control terminal. This feature is crucial for audio applications that require rapid signal level changes without direct manual intervention.

The circuit incorporates various components, such as resistors and capacitors, which work together to stabilize and filter the signal, ensuring efficient and easily controllable amplification.
